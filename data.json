Seniors already account for 11% of the population. By 2050, that share will double to 21% - meaning one in every five Indians will be aged above 60. With longer lifespans, shrinking family units and dual-income households, one truth is clear: More seniors will age alone and with more complex care needs than ever before. On Young Turks Reloaded, Shereen Bhan speaks with Tara Singh Vachani, Executive Chairperson of Antara Senior Care, a company that's determined to reshape how India thinks about ageing and elder care.She recalls Antara’s early years, battling stigma and misconception, when senior care facilities were perceived as aid to abandonment. But now, the mindset has evolved, especially after the pandemic. “People have started believing in wellness a lot more. They have understood that, as they get older, they need an ecosystem to support them,” Tara shares. Today, 60-year-olds are redefining retirement. It’s no longer just about grandchildren and slowing down. They are embracing self-care without guilt - a shift also powered by India’s economic prosperity, which allows seniors to prioritise their own needs while fulfilling obligations to their families. And while the world is busy trying to ‘hack longevity’, Tara believes the focus must be on living well. As she puts it, Antara’s mission is 'to make the years that you are alive as joyful, as healthy, and as happy as possible'.India is ageing fast. Seniors already account for 11% of the population. By 2050, that share will double to 21% - meaning one in every five Indians will be aged above 60. With longer lifespans, shrinking family units and dual-income households, one truth is clear: More seniors will age alone and with more complex care needs than ever before. On Young Turks Reloaded, Shereen Bhan speaks with Tara Singh Vachani, Executive Chairperson of Antara Senior Care, a company that's determined to reshape how India thinks about ageing and elder care.She recalls Antara’s early years, battling stigma and misconception, when senior care facilities were perceived as aid to abandonment. But now, the mindset has evolved, especially after the pandemic. “People have started believing in wellness a lot more. They have understood that, as they get older, they need an ecosystem to support them,” Tara shares. Today, 60-year-olds are redefining retirement. It’s no longer just about grandchildren and slowing down. They are embracing self-care without guilt - a shift also powered by India’s economic prosperity, which allows seniors to prioritise their own needs while fulfilling obligations to their families. And while the world is busy trying to ‘hack longevity’, Tara believes the focus must be on living well. As she puts it, Antara’s mission is 'to make the years that you are alive as joyful, as healthy, and as happy as possible'.]]></description>\n      <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 2 Jan 2026 12:29:58 +0530]]></pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Shreya Chandra</dc:creator>\n      <guid><![CDATA[https://www.cnbctv18.com/access/watchlist/business/ageing-with-dignity-the-antara-senior-care-story-19812512.htm]]></guid>\n      <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n      <media:content height=\"675\" width=\"1200\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2026/01/1767598032_ZPVxkZ3O7B-YT-RELOADED-EP-THUMBS-ANTARAjpg-YPlQNtBa3w.jpg\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[Boeing set to join Bangladesh fleet after protracted battle with Airbus]]></title>\n      <link><![CDATA[https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/boeing-set-to-join-bangladesh-fleet-after-protracted-battle-with-airbus-19812364.htm]]></link>\n      <description><![CDATA[State-run BSS news agency reported that Biman Bangladesh Airlines decided to procure the Boeing aircraft at its annual general meeting as part of its fleet expansion plan.]]></description>\n      <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 2 Jan 2026 11:31:41 +0530]]></pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Juviraj Anchil</dc:creator>\n      <guid><![CDATA[https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/boeing-set-to-join-bangladesh-fleet-after-protracted-battle-with-airbus-19812364.htm]]></guid>\n      <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n      <media:content height=\"675\" width=\"1200\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2022/07/Boeing-Company.jpg\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[RBI new risk-weight rules for NBFC infra loans from April 1: Key takeaways]]></title>\n      <link><![CDATA[https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/finance/rbi-new-risk-weight-rules-nbfc-infrastructure-loans-april-1-key-takeaways-ws-l-19812123.htm]]></link>\n      <description><![CDATA[RBI revises NBFC risk-weight norms for infrastructure projects, lowering risk weights for high-quality projects and setting stricter criteria, effective April 1, 2026, to boost financial stability.]]></description>\n      <pubDate><![CDATA[Fri, 2 Jan 2026 08:20:54 +0530]]></pubDate>\n      <dc:creator>Anshul</dc:creator>\n      <guid><![CDATA[https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/finance/rbi-new-risk-weight-rules-nbfc-infrastructure-loans-april-1-key-takeaways-ws-l-19812123.htm]]></guid>\n      <category><![CDATA[Business]]></category>\n      <media:content height=\"675\" width=\"1200\" medium=\"image\" url=\"https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2023/07/NBFC.jpg\"/>\n    </item>\n    <item>\n      <title><![CDATA[Britannia Industries gets GST order demanding ₹109 crore for FY19–FY24]]></title>\n      <link><![CDATA[https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/stocks/britannia-industries-share-price-gets-gst-order-demanding-rs-109-crore-for-fy19-fy24-19812036.htm]]></link>\n      <description><![CDATA[According to the disclosure, the order covers six financial years from FY 2018–19 to FY 2023–24 and alleges incorrect availment of input tax credit.
